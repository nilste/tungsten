Tungsten is a classic platformer in which you are a young knight battling evil creatures and dangerous hazards.

## About

The game was developed in C# and Unity for the course 1DV437 (Introduction to Game Programming) at Linnaeus University. The goal was to create a darker platformer with great care in the selection of music, inspired by *Inside* and *Golf Club Wasteland*. The course required some specific game mechanics and my art skills are limited, but it turned out decent thanks to publicly available assets.

The game covers three levels with multiple types of enemies, destructible objects, powerups and hazards. All while you collect coins and try to achieve the best time possible to improve your high score. Besides high score, the game also includes a menu, level selection, sound settings, rolling credits and a death screen.
